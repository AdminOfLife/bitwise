  personal background or their technical choices.
- Be friendly and patient with beginners. We're all learning together.
- Use the [forums](http://bitwise.handmade.network) or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/7TSA6ZF) chat server for open-ended discussions.
- GitHub issues and pull requests are reserved for specific issues and fixes. It's _not_ a forum.
