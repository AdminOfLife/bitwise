Q: What is Bitwise?

Q: Who are you?

Q: Why are you doing this project?

Q: How is Bitwise different from something like Handmade Hero?

Q: What do I need to know in advance to follow along?

Q: Seeing there is hardware involved, how much money do I need to spend to participate?

Q: How much time should I expect to spend per week to keep up?

Q: What languages will we be using?

Most systems-level software will be written in our own C-like systems programming language, which
will be implemented in C. We'll also be writing a smattering of RISC V assembly language by hand.
Along the way, I plan to show implementations of other kinds of languages, like Forth, Lisp, and
an embeddable scripting language. But the only language you need to know fluently in advance is C.

For hardware design, we'll be using a hardware description language (HDL) of our own design. It will
compile to Verilog, so we will to learn to read and write a basic subset of Verilog. It's not assumed
you know Verilog or any other HDL in advance.
