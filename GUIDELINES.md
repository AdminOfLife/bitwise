# Community Guidelines
- When interacting with others in the Bitwise community, always be respectful. We do not
  tolerate bullying, shaming, name calling or discrimination, whether it concerns someone's
  personal background or their technical choices.
- Be friendly and patient with beginners. We're all learning together.
- Use the [forums](http://bitwise.handmade.network) or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/7TSA6ZF) chat server for open-ended discussions.

# GitHub Issues and Pull Requests
- GitHub issues and pull requests are reserved for specific issues and fixes. It's _not_ a forum.
- Issues and pull requests must be written in a neutral, constructive tone, like you were addressing a coworker.
- Issues can be used for reporting bugs and other specific issues. Issues may also be used for
  general requests, but make sure you first read all the docs and understand the project goals.
- Pull requests must be focused on specific fixes. Code bugs, broken links and typos are fair game,
  but see below. Large scale design or code proposals are explicitly off-topic for pull requests.
  You can discuss such changes on the forums.
- Fresh on-stream code is going to be subject to rapid change. Unless it's committed to an already
  stable part of the codebase (and right now there are no stable parts), it's not worth submitting
  pull requests for small, semi-obvious bugs if that part of the code is clearly in flux. Often
  such bugs will have been fixed locally or would be discovered naturally on the next stream.
