# Community Guidelines
- When interacting with others in the Bitwise community, be respectful of others. We do not
  tolerate bullying, shaming, name calling or discrimination, whether it concerns someone's
  personal background or their technical choices.
- Be friendly and patient with beginners. We're all learning together.
- Use the http://bitwise.handmade.network forums or the Discord server for open-ended discussions.
- GitHub issues and pull requests are reserved for specific issues and fixes. It's _not_ a forum.
- Issues and pull requests must be expressed in a neutral, professional tone.
